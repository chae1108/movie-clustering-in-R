# movie-clustering-in-R

### Description
In this project, I used hierarchical clustering algorithm in R to group movies based on genre.  I repeated the project in Python and used PCA to visualize clusters in a 2-D scatterplot.

### Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Analytics Edge, an online course from EdX.  In the dataset, each movie is given a binary value for each of the 20 genres including Action, Adventure, and Western.
